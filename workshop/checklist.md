# Checklist

A great workshop requires a bit of preparation. Here you find the preflight checklists: crossing all items off will set you up for a successful and enjoyable workshop.

## People

* [ ] Organise the workshop participants into groups of five people, plus or minus one each. 
* [ ] Keep the number of groups to at most four in a room. It will get noisy and distracting otherwise.
* [ ] Appoint workshop facilitators: one for every two groups is a good ratio. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Participants** learn, reflect and connect as part of their group. Keep this opportunity for team building in mind when assigning groups.
{% endhint %}

## Venue

* [ ] Facility to present the instruction deck visible to all participants at all times during the workshop
* [ ] Space for each group to put two A0-sized canvases side by side. Tables or walls work equally well.
* [ ] Space for facilitators and participants alike to move around without obstructions.
* [ ] A place to service water, tea and coffee, and light refreshments during the workshop.
* [ ] A place for participants to withdraw from the proceedings and recharge a bit.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tables** should measure 80x160 cm or better to accommodate for a group's work effort. Make sure each participant has at least 90 cm of spare room.  
{% endhint %}

## Materials

* [ ] Pens for all participants; [Sharpie markers](https://www.sharpie.com/markers) are a good choice.
* [ ] Sticky notes in at least two colours, and in [3x3"](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticking-Janeiro-Collection-654-24SSAU-CP/dp/B00CMKA9HK/ref=sr_1_8) and [3x5"](https://www.amazon.com/Post-6555PK-Original-Colors-100-Sheet/dp/B00006JNNG/ref=sr_1_3) sizes.
