# Frame

Your organisation inhabits an [ecosystem](../../extras/glossary.md#ecosystem) that likely extends beyond segment, industry, or sector. Retrieving the precise limits of the ecosystem is an arduous task with limited returns. Better, you identify the people and organisations most intertwined with the ecosystem's fate—for ill as well as for good. 

How do the outcomes they generate affect the ecosystem? How are they in turn affected by others' actions? What are their interests and what do they expect from their involvement? 

The answers to these questions shape the platform's purpose and direct its design. You'll build up to these answers in three steps:

* 👨👩👧👦[Entities](entities.md) of the ecosystem
* 🎭[Roles](roles.md) of the entities
* 🏁[Motivations](motivations.md) of the roles
