📖 The core structure of this manual hails from the design approach described in the [Platform Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Platform-Scale-emerging-business-investment-ebook/dp/B015FAOKJ6) book. [The KeyStone Advantage](https://www.amazon.com/Keystone-Advantage-Ecosystems-Innovation-Sustainability/dp/1591393078) inspired the introduction of the [Keystone role](glossary.md#keystone). The Transaction and Innovation Engines take after the platform types described by [The Business of Platforms](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Platforms-Strategy-Competition-Innovation-ebook/dp/B07DTFNJWR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ARGN963PP0TX&dchild=1&keywords=business+of+platforms&qid=1587385097&s=digital-text&sprefix=business+of+pla%2Cdigital-text%2C248&sr=1-1) book.

🏗 Working with [Platform Design Toolkit](https://platformdesigntoolkit.com) for several years built up to [invaluable lessons](https://stories.platformdesigntoolkit.com/ing-ron-kersic-platforms-at-scale-bba1ac92fe6) of what works in platform design and [what less so](https://trello.com/c/2QqMIYW4/35-pdt-legacy). This manual retains the toolkit's overall structure, while completely reimagining the [design artefacts](../workshop/canvases.md).

👩🎨👨🎨 [Franklin de Bekker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franklindebekker/) guided the [Ecosystem Role Portrait](../workshop/canvases.md#ecosystem-role-portrait) to its current [human-centered form](../workshop/canvases.md#ecosystem-role-portrait). [Robin Bonke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinbonke/) designed the [Platform Experience Map](../workshop/canvases.md#platform-experience-map) and its associated game mechanics.
