This is the [FAST](https://futuring-architectures.com/) manual to [positioning platforms](extras/glossary.md#platform-position). It will be your companion in finding a platform's ****purpose and strategy: for your current organisation or department, a partner or competitor, or a future endeavour. 

The manual comes with all the [materials](extras/downloads/) you need to start [facilitating](workshop/format.md) high-energy platform sessions. No consultants or coaches, no boot camps or certifications. All batteries included; just add elbow grease.

Platforms are complex things and no tool can detract from that. What this manual _can_ do, is slice through the complexity layer by layer. You''ll find each layer easy enough to get into and well-suited for collaborative work.  Link them all together, and the intricacies and dynamics of the platform unfold in full:

These five layers show up all over the manual: in the schedule of [your next workshop](workshop/format.md), in the [downloadable design tools](extras/downloads/), and as individual [chapters](position/layers.md). In each chapter, you'll find short [instruction videos](bonus/diaform/#instructions) that will have you positioning platforms in no time. **So, delve right in...**ðŸ‘‰
